# Introduction

This is a time management program. I created it to motivate me to spend chosen
amounts of time working on projects or completing work.

# Features

You can programmatically choose:
* How long to work on a given day
* An event to display when run.

# Installation

Clone the repository, and run `manager.py` with Python version 3 or above. The
program also requires [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and it's dependencies to be installed.
